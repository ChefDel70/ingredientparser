# ingredientparser
Web-Scraping parser designed to parse Unique ingredients from the NRDC website.


This program was designed to extract information from a open-source government website.  
The information extracted was a list of all 50 states, the entire year broken down bi-weekly per month,
and the ingredients that were "in season" during that period of time.

The information is being used for our project www.theseasonalchef.co

The ingredients are part of an API search that returns recipes to the user that are utilizing those ingredients.
